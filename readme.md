# Mineme
This is a simple colorscheme that I've created because I haven't found neither one that I like nor one that allows me to easily customize it

### Installing + Dependecies

It depens on [colorbuddy.nvim](https://github.com/tjdevries/colorbuddy.nvim)

To install with lazy.nvim:
    { "Alfurtx/mineme", dependencies = { "tjdevries/colorbuddy.nvim", branch = "dev" },init = function() require('mineme').setup() end }
